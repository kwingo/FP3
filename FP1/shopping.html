            <p>Shopping is very therapeutic to me. What I enjoy most about shopping is that it's somewhat of a "mini vacation."</p>
            <p>Shopping is a relatively mindless, yet relaxing activity. What's even more enjoyable? Online shopping.</p>
            <p>I prefer online shopping versus going in stores because when you shop online, you cut out having to wait in long lines or having to move through a large crowd of people.</p>
