            <p>Within the past few years, I've grown to love cars.</p>
            <p>From old school cars to brand new. I'm just amazed how cars have come along technology wise in just ten years.</p>
            <p>What I like most how technology has evolved with cars is how 7-8 inch infotainment screens are now standard in most cars, whereas ten years ago, having a CD player in your car was a must-have.</p>
            <p>I also like how engineers have come together to provide a great entertainment system, yet make sure you stay on top of your car's overall health when it comes to tires, oil checks, lane assist, adaptive cruise control, etc all at your fingertips. All of these great features are awesome and will have you finding excuses just to drive anywhere, whether it's to the store and back or just to drive around the corner.</p>
            <p>Some of my favorite makes are Acura, Audi, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Dodge, Mercedes-Benz, and Nissan. I'm open to enjoying different models from different makes that I did not list, but those are my go-to, especially when it's time to go car shopping. :) </p>
